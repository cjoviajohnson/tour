        The district of Ernakulam takes its name from Ernakulam, which is the centre of Kochi in Kerala, India. Here are several significant buildings, including the Kerala High Court, the Kochi Municipal Corporation office, and the Cochin Shipyard. The administrative centre of the Ernakulam District was first located at Ernakulam but was subsequently moved to Kakkanad, an area in eastern Kochi. The former capital of the Kingdom of Cochin was Ernakulam. The area can affirm that during the ancient and mediaeval periods, it significantly aided Kerala's trading contacts with the outside world. The Chera Dynasty of the Sangam era, which reigned over substantial sections of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, is tied to the early political history of Ernakulam. The region was thereafter governed by the Kingdom of Cochin after the Cheras.

              <h5>Ernakulam Shiva Temple</h5>
              <p>One of Kerala's most important temples, Ernakulam Shiva Temple, also called Ernakulathappan Temple, is situated in the centre of Ernakulam, Kochi, Kerala, India. According to local Hindu beliefs and customs, the temple, which is devoted to Lord Shiva, is regarded as the city temple, with the presiding god serving as the city's guardian. The deity is reverently referred to as Ernakulathappan, which means Lord of Ernakulam, in accordance with typical practise in Kerala. At the moment, Cochin Devaswam Board is in charge of running the temple. Under the active sponsorship of Diwan Sri Edakkunni Sankara Warrier, the temple was constructed in its present shape in 1846, elevating it to the status of a Royal temple in the Kochi Kingdom. The temple is situated on a single acre of ground.  </p>
