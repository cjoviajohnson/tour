              <h5>St. Angelo Fort</h5>
              <p>Three kilometres from Canannore (Kannur), a city in Kerala state, south India, lies St. Angelo Fort, also known as Kannur Fort or Kannur Kotta, a fort that faces the Arabian Sea. Portuguese were given permission to establish a settlement in Kerala in 1498 by the native Kolathiri monarch, who was Vasco da Gama's host during his voyage to India. He authorised Francisco de Almeida, the ruler of Portugal, to construct a fort there on October 23, 1505. The foundation stone was set the very following day, on October 24, 1505, by Goncalo Gil Barbosa, the Portuguese factor of Cannanore (Kannur). On October 30, 1505, the timber fort's construction was finished.

              <h5>Arakkal Royal Palace</h5>
              <p>The sole Muslim royal dynasty in Kerala, India, is the Arakkal family, whose museum is named after them. Actually, the museum is a portion of the Arakkalkettu (Arakkal Royal Palace). The Kerala State Government turned the palace's durbar hall part into a museum. It was renovated for Rs. 9,000,000 before being reopened in July 2005.The Arakkalkettu was rebuilt by the government, but it remains privately held by the Arakkal Royal Trust and is not governed by the Archaeological Survey of India, the nation's archaeological agency. The Arakkal Family's tradition, which was important to Malabar's history, was being carefully preserved by the government..</p>
