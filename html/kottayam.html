        Kottayam, a region noted for its exceptional attributes, is bordered by the Western Ghats on the east and the Vembanad Lake and paddy fields of Kuttanad on the west. Many of the early Malayalam daily newspapers, including Deepika, Malayala Manorama, and Mangalam, as well as a number of publishing companies, have their main offices in Kottayam. Every political struggle of the contemporary era has included Kottayam. Kottayam is where the "Malayali Memorial" movement is said to have started. The Malayali Memorial aimed to ensure that educated Travancoreans had greater representation versus outsiders in the Travancore government service.

              <p>St. Mary’s Orthodox Syrian Church, Kottayam, commonly known as Kottayam Cheriapally, is a Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church located in Kottayam, Kerala, India. Cheriapally meaning ‘small church’, whose appearance contradicts its name, is one of the oldest and well-preserved churches in the state. Cheriapally is located on the way to Kumarakom from Kottayam. The church is dedicated to mother Mary. Kottayam Cheriapally, built in 1579, has retained its old world charm today as well even after so much of environmental changes. The length and breadth of the church is constructed with innovative paintings, mural, and architecture. Before the inception of the Old Seminary in 1815, Kottayam Cheriapally was the Head quarters of the Church and Malankara Metropolitans for a long time.. </p>
