        In the Indian state of Kerala, there is a city and municipality called Palakkad, sometimes called Palghat. The Palakkad District's administrative centre is there. About 146 kilometres (91 miles) northeast of Kochi is where the city is located. The rice bowl of Kerala is another name for Palakkad. One of the 23 Indian Institutes of Technology is located in Palakkad. Government Victoria College, one of the state's oldest institutions of higher learning, opened its doors in 1888. NSS College of Engineering, Kerala's fourth engineering college, opened its doors in 1960. The commonly held belief is that the name Palakkad is a fusion of two Malayalam words: Pāla, which is the local name for blackboard tree, and Kātŭ, which means forest

              <h5>Palakkad Fort</h5>
              <p>Palakkad Fort is an old fort situated in the heart of Palakkad town of Kerala state, southern India. It was recaptured and rebuilt grandly by Sultan Hyder Ali in 1766 A.D and remains one of the best-preserved forts in Kerala. The Palakkad Fort is said to have existed from very ancient times but believed to be constructed in the present form in 1766 A.D, but little is known of its early history. The local ruler, Palakkad Achchan, was originally a tributary of the Zamorin but had become independent before the beginning of the eighteenth century.

              <p>Dhoni Waterfalls is located around 15 km from Palakkad and around 34 km from Kollengode Town in Palakkad. An entry pass is required before entering the area. The waterfalls are 4 kilometres away from the bottom of the slope. On the climb up, one can observe water pouring between the rocks because the roads are not paved. There are no limitations on bringing food to the top. When at the top, one can take a dip in the chilly water and take in the wonderful view of the waterfalls. One may experience the splendour of the forests and learn that they are home to elephants and leopards by scaling the cliffs. </p>
