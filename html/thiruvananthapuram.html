              <h5>The Napier Museum </h5>
              <p>The Napier Museum is an art and natural history museum situated in Thiruvananthapuram, India. A building was constructed in 1857 during the reign of Uthram Thirunal Marthanda Varma, and later demolished in 1874 to lay foundation for a new building, during the reign of Ayilyam Thirunal. The Governor of Madras in 1872 appointed Robert Chisholm, a consulting architect of the Madras Government to design a new museum. In 1880, construction finished and the museum opened to the public, bearing the namesake of its governor, Francis Napier, 10th Lord Napier. Some of the building features include a gothic roof and minarets. The Napier Museum, a landmark of the city, is noted for its unique ornamentation and architectural style, which is influenced by Indian, Chinese, Kerala and Mughal Schools of Architecture.
