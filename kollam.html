        Kollam , also known by its former name Quilon , is an ancient seaport and city on the Malabar Coast of India bordering the Laccadive Sea, which is a part of the Arabian Sea. From the beginning, Kollam has had a positive business reputation. For millennia, commerce between the Arabs, Phoenicians, Chinese, Ethiopians, Syrians, Jews, Chaldeans, and Romans has taken place at the port of Kollam. Kollam became the centre of trade and politics as a result of Chinese trade, and in the 14th century, Ibn Battuta listed it among the five Indian ports he had visited throughout his twenty-four-year journeys. In Kerala, Kollam is still a significant hub for commerce and business.
