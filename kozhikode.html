        Kozhikode, commonly known as Calicut in English, is a city in the Indian state of Kerala that is located along the Malabar Coast. It is the second biggest metropolitan region in Kerala and the 19th largest in India, with a corporate limit population of 609,224[6] and a metropolitan population of more than 2 million.  Kozhikode is categorised by the Indian government as a Tier 2 city. It served as the capital of the Malabar district during the British rule and is the biggest city in the Malabar area. Because it served as the primary commercial hub for Indian spices during antiquity and the Middle Ages, Kozhikode was known as the "City of Spices." It served as the seat of government for a separate kingdom controlled by the Samoothiris.
