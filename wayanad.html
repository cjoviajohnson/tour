              <h5>Edakkal Caves</h5>
              <p>The Edakkal caves are two natural caves at a remote location at Edakkal, 25 km (15.5 mi) from Kalpetta in the Wayanad district of Kerala in India's Western Ghats. They lie 1,200 m (3,900 ft) above sea level on Ambukutty Mala, near an ancient trade route connecting the high mountains of Mysore to the ports of the Malabar coast. Inside the caves are pictorial writings believed to date to at least 6,000 BCE, from the Neolithic man, indicating the presence of a prehistoric settlement in this region. The Stone Age carvings of Edakkal are rare and are the only known examples from South India besides those of Shenthurini, Kollam also in Kerala.

              <p>The Indian Banasurasagar Project, which includes a dam and a canal project, was began in 1979 and includes the Banasura Sagar Dam, which impounds the Karamanathodu tributary of the Kabini River. The project's objectives are to assist the Kakkayam Hydroelectric Power Project and meet the region's water needs for irrigation and drinking during the arid seasons. Kuttiyadi Augmentation Main Earthen Dam is another name for the dam. The dam is 38.5 metres (126 feet) tall and 685 metres long (2,247 ft). A group of islands that were created when the reservoir flooded the nearby territories may be found in the dam's reservoir. In the distance are the islands and the Banasura highlands</p>
